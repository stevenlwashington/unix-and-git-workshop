A repository is a collection of all versions of a project: who, what, when, etc. Also includes a collection of commits describing changes to my project as I work
Commit or committing is the act of telling the VCS that a version is finished
VCS provides a set of tools to review history and ways to share/collaborate with others and keep track of all changes
